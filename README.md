Hi,

The codes for the mathematical modeling and control of a distillation column operated with methanol-water are from my bachelor thesis. They include an S-function, which represents the mathematical modeling of the column, and control actions based on the S-function. The distillate and bottom control actions are carried out separately before they are simulated in an interactive way. For more information, please check out the thesis I provided in pdf.

pH controller codes for a bioreactor is a work I did in my internship. They are modifications that extend the functionality of the existing YEASTsim simulator used in the article entitled "A MATLAB-based simulator for the study of process control of fed-batch yeast fermentations" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ece.2024.06.001). Further modifications for mathematical modeling in the bioreactor are carried out as well. My work in the internship is summed up in the final report that I presented to my supervisor, which is also uploaded here. This document also presents the simulation results I carried out.

They are all implemented in MATLAB.
