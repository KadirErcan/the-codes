Hi,

The codes for the mathematical modeling and control of a distillation column operated with methanol-water are from my bachelor thesis. They include an S-function, which represents the mathematical modeling of the column, and control actions based on the S-function. 

pH controller code for a bioreactor is a work I did in my internship. This pH controller code is a modification that extends the functionality of the existing YEASTsim simulator used in the article entitled "A MATLAB-based simulator for the study of process control of fed-batch yeast fermentations" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ece.2024.06.001). Further modifications for mathematical modeling in the bioreactor are carried out.
They are all implemented in MATLAB.
